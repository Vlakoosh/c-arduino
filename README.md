# Infrastructure 2 - Term 4

In this class I learned about programming embedded systems with C and Arduino uno (atmega328p)

# Semester project
### Tetris

# Weekly Projects

### Week 1 LED Library

In this project, I made my first reusable C library for velleman shield components.
I learned how to import extra library directories to platform IO projects

### Week 2 Morse Trainer

In this project, I learned how to use arrays and pointers in C, along with button inputs.
I also had to write a custom library for Arduino shield buttons.

### Week 2 Simon Says Game

Same as in last project, I used arrays and pointers in C, along with button inputs.
I also used the button library and LED library here.

### Week 3 Nim

In this project, I learned how to use a 7 segment 4 digit display with Arduino and shift registers. I also used buttons and LEDs to make a simple "take matches away" game.

### Week 4 Lunar Lander

In this project I used built in Arduino timers, LEDs, and button inputs and interrupts to simulate a free-falling lunar lander.


# Libraries

### LED Library
Library for enabling and turning on and off LEDs on the velleman Arduino shield. It also contains functions for dimming, fading in, and fading out LEDs.

### Button Library
Library for enabling button pins as inputs and reading button states (pressed or not)

### Buzzer Library
Library for enabling the buzzer as output, playing musical notes, and making sounds with a Piezo buzzer.

### 8x16 LED Matrix Library
Library for a custom 8x16 LED matrix made with 4 74hc595 shift registers. It can enable clock, data, and data push pins to select rows and columns on the display. It can also select multiple rows and columns at a time and even print out an entire "screen array" at once.

### Timer Library 
Library for quick setup of timer interrupts.
